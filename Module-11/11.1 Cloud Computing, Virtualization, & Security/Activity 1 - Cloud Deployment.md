## Activity Objective

Students will evaluate and determine the most suitable cloud solution—public, private, hybrid, or multi-cloud—for a given scenario. They will justify their decision by analyzing key characteristics of each cloud model, aligning their choice with the specific business needs described in the scenario, and addressing relevant security concerns. 

Students will demonstrate their understanding by presenting a comprehensive explanation of why their chosen cloud solution effectively meets the requirements and mitigates potential risks.

## Activity Instructions:
Follow the instructions below to complete the knowledge check:
1. Read each scenario carefully.
2. Analyze the business needs, security requirements, scalability demands, and operational complexity described.
3. Decide whether a public, private, hybrid, or multi-cloud solution is most appropriate for the scenario.
4. Justify your decision with clear reasoning, using what you've learned about each cloud model


### Knowledge Check
1. **Scenario:** A tech startup is launching a new web-based productivity tool for small businesses. They expect unpredictable growth but need to get to market quickly and on a tight budget. Security is important, but the tool will primarily handle general business data (non-sensitive). They are looking for a solution that can scale easily without much upfront investment in infrastructure or IT management.

    **Question:** Which cloud model should the startup choose? Why?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
The startup should choose a Public Cloud model because it offers low upfront costs, quick deployment, and the ability to easily scale as their business grows. Since the tool will handle general, non-sensitive business data, the public cloud provides enough security while allowing the team to focus on development instead of managing infrastructure. This makes it the most cost-effective and flexible option for a small startup on a tight budget.

2. **Scenario:** A healthcare provider needs to manage sensitive patient records and comply with strict HIPAA regulations. They want to develop a custom application for internal use, requiring the highest level of security and data privacy. While most services will be for internal employees, there is also a need to integrate with external partners (e.g., insurance companies) securely.

    **Question:** Which cloud model would best meet their needs? Why?

<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
The healthcare provider should choose a Private Cloud model because it offers the highest level of security, control, and compliance needed to handle sensitive patient records under HIPAA regulations. A private cloud allows the organization to fully manage and secure its infrastructure, ensuring that data privacy and compliance standards are strictly enforced. While the application is mainly for internal employees, a private cloud can still enable secure connections with external partners like insurance companies through controlled access methods. This model gives the provider the flexibility of cloud computing while maintaining strict control over sensitive healthcare data.

3. **Scenario:** An e-commerce company operates globally and uses cloud-based platforms to serve customers in different regions. They handle high volumes of traffic, which peaks during certain periods (e.g., Black Friday sales). They want a solution that allows them to leverage different cloud providers in different regions for performance and compliance reasons, while ensuring high availability across the board.

    **Question:** Which cloud model would best meet their needs? Why?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
The e-commerce company should use a Multi-Cloud model because it allows them to run their services across multiple cloud providers, taking advantage of each provider’s strengths in different regions. This approach helps improve performance by serving customers closer to their location, ensures compliance with regional data laws, and reduces the risk of downtime since operations can continue even if one provider experiences an outage. Multi-cloud also gives the company flexibility and resilience, which is critical during peak traffic events like Black Friday.

4. **Scenario:** A government agency manages several mission-critical systems that must remain online 24/7 and cannot risk downtime. These systems handle classified data that must remain isolated from external networks, but there is a growing need to collaborate with other public-sector agencies and occasionally interact with external contractors on non-sensitive projects.

    **Question:** Which cloud model would you recommend? Why?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
The government agency should use a Hybrid Cloud model. This allows them to keep their mission-critical, classified systems in a Private Cloud (or on-premises data center) to ensure maximum security and isolation from external networks, while still using a Public Cloud for less sensitive workloads like collaboration with other agencies or external contractors. By combining both, the agency can protect classified data with strict security controls while gaining the flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency of the public cloud for non-sensitive projects. This balance supports 24/7 availability, security, and the collaboration they need.

5. **Scenario:** A group of public universities in the same state collaborate to build an environment that could support research projects, student record management, and online learning platforms. Since all the universities face similar compliance requirements around student privacy and data protection, they agree to share infrastructure, costs, and security responsibilities. Each university maintains its own access and control over its data, but they benefit from the shared resources, compliance framework, and ability to collaborate more easily on joint projects.

    **Question:** Which cloud model would you recommend? Why?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
The best fit here is a Community Cloud model. This setup is designed for organizations that share similar compliance requirements, security needs, and goals. By pooling resources, the universities can lower costs compared to each building their own private cloud while still maintaining strong privacy controls for student records. Each university keeps control over its own data, but they all benefit from shared infrastructure, common security standards, and easier collaboration on research and education initiatives. This makes a community cloud ideal for their shared needs.
