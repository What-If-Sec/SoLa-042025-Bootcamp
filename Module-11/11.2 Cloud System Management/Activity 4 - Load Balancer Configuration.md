## Activity Objective

Students will deploy and configure a load balancer along with appropriate load balancing rules and firewall settings to enable secure access to their DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) virtual machines (VMs) over the internet. Following the setup, students will simulate a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by disabling one web server to observe traffic redirection to the backup server. By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
1. Explain the role of load balancers in ensuring network redundancy and high availability.
2. Configure an Azure load balancer to distribute traffic between multiple Web Server VMs hosting DVWA.
3. Enable public access to the DVWA through the load balancer.
4. Simulate a DoS attack by turning off one web server and analyze the impact on traffic distribution.
5. Evaluate the effectiveness of the load balancer in maintaining service availability during simulated failure conditions.
