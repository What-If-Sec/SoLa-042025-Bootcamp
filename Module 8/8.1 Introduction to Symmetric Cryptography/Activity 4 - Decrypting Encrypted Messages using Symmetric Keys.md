## Activity Objective

By the end of this activity, students will be able to decrypt a message using a classmate’s symmetric encryption key and IV, and critically reflect on the security challenges and limitations of symmetric key cryptography, particularly around key exchange and trust. 

Through this process, students will gain a deeper understanding of why protecting encryption keys are vital and explore the potential risks involved in sharing keys insecurely, helping them build foundational knowledge for more secure communication methods.

## Activity Instructions

In this activity you will use the symmetric key and IV provided to decrypt the encrypted message provided by your classmate.

After decrypting the message, answer the reflection questions below:
1. How secure is your encrypted message if someone else knows both your key and IV? What does this tell you about the importance of keeping keys secret?
2. What risks are introduced when you have to share your key and IV with someone else to allow decryption?
3. Within the previous activity you uploaded your key and IV within the assignment, how could this introduce a security risk? What if you emailed your key and IV instead?
4. When you received another student’s key and IV to decrypt their message, what assumptions did you make about the safety and authenticity of that information? Would you know if it was intercepted before it came to you and tampered with?
5. If someone intercepted your key and IV during submission, could they decrypt or even modify your message?
6. Based on this experience, what do you think are the biggest weaknesses of symmetric key cryptography?
7. Can you think of any ways to share encryption keys more securely?

> Note: Answers to the reflection questions will not be provided. The purpose of this reflection is to help students critically think about the challenges and limitations of symmetric key cryptography, especially when it comes to key sharing and security risks.

>There are no right or wrong answers here, instead focus on your observations, thought process, and what you've learned from the experience. We will explore key takeaways in the next class.
