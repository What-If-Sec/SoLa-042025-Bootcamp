## Activity Objectives

Students will configure and deploy either a Kali Linux or ParrotOS virtual machine to create an integrated cybersecurity testing environment. This hands-on activity will prepare students for engaging in  realistic red team and blue team scenarios, where they will assume roles as attackers (red team) using Kali Linux or ParrotOS, and defenders (blue team) using an intrusion detection/prevention system to monitor, detect potential threats.

## Pre-Work Instructions
> Note: ALWAYS verify the checksum of the ISO image before booting!!!
>
> This ensures that the ISO image hasn’t been tampered with or corrupted during download. If it fails to verify, try downloading again. If it still fails to verify again, check the URL, and then try downloading from another computer or another network.

Follow the instructions below for Windows and Mac Intel Chip (AMD) Users:
1. Go to the settings of your Ubuntu Server VM (from your Linux Admin Projecta) and within the hypervisor (i.e., VirtualBox, VMWare, etc.) ensure that the  the 1st network adapter is configured as a bridge adapter, and then add a 2nd network adapter and set it as a internal network.
2. Log into your Ubuntu Server VM, this will act as your Blue Team VM.
3. Within your Blue Team VM install snort by executing `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt install snort -y && snort -v`. (Note: You will be configuring snort to work in later activities.)
4. Within your Blue Team VM install apache by executing `sudo apt install apache2 -y`, and then enable your apache web server to enable ssl by running `sudo a2enmod ssl`. Learn more about apache [here](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/apache-web-server-introduction), and learn more about servers vs. server applications like apache, nginx, etc. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXmvM2QtuMU&t=10s).
5. Within your Blue Team VM enable ssh by executing `sudo systemctl enable ssh`. If you do not have OpenSSH installed by default on your VM, install SSH by executing `sudo apt install openssh-server`.
6. Next, download either Kali Linux or Parrot OS: Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obc6Y8aEJkM) to learn more about both VM operating systems. You can download Kali Linux from [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) and follow the instructions [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/), or download the ParrotOS Live Security AMD64 iso from [here](https://parrotsec.org/download/) and follow the instructions [here](https://parrotsec.org/docs/installation/) to deploy your new VM.
7. Configure your Red Team VM (Kali Linux or Parrot) using the requirements below. And after installation execute `sudo apt update && sud apt full-upgrade -y`.
8. Once both VMs have been configured, ping your Red Team VM from your Blue Team VM and vice versa using `ping -c 4 <insert-target-ip-address>`. (Note: Use `ip a` to obtain the IPv4 address of your VM.) You should see 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, and 0% packet loss.
   

Follow the instructions below for Mac M1, M2, etc. Chip (ARM) Users:
1. Go to the settings of your Ubuntu Server VM (from your Linux Admin Projecta) and within the hypervisor (i.e., VirtualBox, VMWare, etc.) ensure that the  the 1st network adapter is configured as a bridge adapter, and then add a 2nd network adapter and set it as a internal network.
2. Log into your Ubuntu Server VM, this will act as your Blue Team VM.
3. Within your Blue Team VM install snort by executing `sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y && sudo apt install snort -y && snort -v`. (Note: You will be configuring snort to work in later activities.)
4. Within your Blue Team VM install apache by executing `sudo apt install apache2 -y`, and then enable your apache web server to enable ssl by running `sudo a2enmod ssl`.

6. Next, download either Kali Linux or Parrot OS: Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obc6Y8aEJkM) to learn more about both VM operating systems. You can download Kali Linux from [here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) and follow the instructions [here](https://www.kali.org/docs/virtualization/install-virtualbox-guest-vm/), or download ParrotOS Virtual Security-Based Arm64 VM from [here](https://parrotsec.org/download/)(select Virtual -> Security -> ARM64) and then deploy. (Note: ParrotOS is recommended for UTM users).
7. Configure your Red Team (Kali Linux or Parrot) VM using the requirements below. And after installation execute `sudo apt update && sud apt full-upgrade -y`.
8. Once both VMs have been configured, ping your Red Team VM from your Blue Team VM and vice versa using `ping -c 4 <insert-target-ip-address>`. (Note: Use `ip a` to obtain the IPv4 address of your VM.) You should see 4 packets transmitted, 4 received, and 0% packet loss.

### Kali Linux System Requirements:

- CPU: 2-4 Core CPU (x86_64 architecture, Intel or AMD)
- RAM: 2 GB (4 GB recommended for a smoother experience)
- Storage: 30 GB of hard disk space (40 GB recommended)
- Graphics: Basic support with 1024x768 resolution
- Network: Configure the 1st network adapter as a bridge adapter, and the  2nd network adapter  as the internal network. 

### Parrot System Requirements:

- CPU: 2 Core CPU (x86_64 architecture, Intel or AMD)
- RAM: 2 GB (4 GB recommended for a smoother experience)
- Storage: 30 GB of hard disk space (40 GB recommended)
- Graphics: Basic support with 1024x768 resolution
- Network: Configure the 1st network adapter as a bridge adapter, and the  2nd network adapter  as the internal network. 

------
> Note:  This lab is currently set up with a basic Red Team (Kali or Parrot OS) and Blue Team environment to simulate attacker and defender roles.
>
> In a more advanced setup, we could improve this environment by adding a Purple Team VM, such as one running Security Onion, to serve as an observer and analyst system. This would allow us to monitor both attack and defense activity from a neutral perspective, correlate alerts, and analyze logs across the network.
>
> Security Onion includes tools like Zeek, Suricata, and Kibana, which provide deeper visibility and help bridge the gap between offense and defense, a key role of a purple team.
