##Activity Objective

This knowledge check is designed to help students’ review their understanding of key Layer 1 and Layer 2 networking concepts, including the roles and functions of physical and data link layer devices, transmission media, MAC addressing, and historical network setups. 

By completing this activity, students will demonstrate their ability to identify core networking hardware, distinguish between communication types, and explain how networks operated before routers became standard.



## Activity Instructions

Use your notes, the lecture slides, as well as the internet to help you in completing the knowledge check.

### Knowledge Check
1. Which of the following devices operates purely at the Physical Layer (Layer 1) of the OSI model?
   1. Router
   2. Hub
   3. Switch
   4. Bridge
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Hub
</details>

2. Which Layer 2 device uses MAC addresses to forward frames?
   1. Modem
   2. Hub
   3. Switch
   4. WAP
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Switch
</details>

3. What is the primary difference between a hub and a switch?
   1. A hub is wireless; a switch is wired
   2. A hub works at Layer 3; a switch works at Layer 1
   3. A switch cannot connect multiple devices; A hub forwards data to all ports
   4. A hub forwards data to all ports; a switch forwards only to the correct port
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A hub forwards data to all ports; a switch forwards only to the correct port
</details>

4. Which of the following is a physical transmission medium used in Layer 1 networking? Select all that apply.
   1. Ethernet (Twisted Pair) Cable
   2. Fiber Optic Cable
   3. Coax Cable
   4. Bluetooth
   5. Switch
   6. Wi-Fi
   7. Hub
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A physical medium is the actual material or channel through which data physically travels in a network. It’s part of the OSI Layer 1 (Physical Layer) and is responsible for carrying the electrical signals, light pulses, or radio waves that represent data. A hub or switch is a network device, not a medium. 
</details>


5. Briefly explain how home or office networks operated before routers became common.
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Before routers, networks used modems and hubs or switches. Each computer may have connected directly to the modem or used manual IP settings, so sharing internet across devices was more difficult.
</details>

6. Bridges and switches both operate at Layer 2 and use MAC addresses to forward traffic.
   1. True
   2. False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
True
</details>

7. What is a MAC address? Select all that apply.
   1. A device’s unique hardware identifier
   2. A device’s unique network identifier
   3. A device’s unique address that is dynamically assigned.
   4. A device’s unique address that is static.
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A MAC address is a device’s unique hardware identifier that is static.
</details>

8. What is MAC spoofing?
   1. Changing or faking a device’s MAC address to appear as another
   2. Encrypting MAC addresses for privacy
   3. Using a switch to hide a MAC address
   4. Replacing the NIC to reset the MAC address
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Changing or faking a device’s MAC address to appear as another
</details>

9. What is a Network Interface Card (NIC)?
   1. A hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network
   2. A device's firmware used to manage MAC addresses
   3. A device that converts wireless to wired traffic
   4. A type of cable used in Ethernet communication
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A hardware component that allows a device to connect to a network
</details>

10. What is the primary function of a Wireless Access Point (WAP)?
    1. To assign IP addresses to devices on the network
    2. To amplify wireless signals for longer distances
    3. To manage internet traffic at the gateway
    4. To provide a bridge between wired and wireless devices at Layer 2
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
To provide a bridge between wired and wireless devices at Layer 2
</details>

11. How does a bridge differ from a switch?
     1. A bridge connects only wireless devices, while a switch connects wired ones
     2. A bridge typically has fewer ports and is used to segment traffic between network sections, while a switch has more ports and operates at a higher speed.
     3. A bridge operates at Layer 1, while a switch operates at Layer 2
     4. A bridge assigns MAC addresses to devices, while a switch does not
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
Through multiple hubs
</details>

12. Why are traditional network bridges rarely used in modern physical networks?
     1. They can be complex to troubleshoot, and can introduce security risks
     2. There's limited scalability due to the small number of physical ports.
     3. Routers are now used for network-level communication instead.
     4. Switches have replaced them by offering more ports, speed, and advanced features.
