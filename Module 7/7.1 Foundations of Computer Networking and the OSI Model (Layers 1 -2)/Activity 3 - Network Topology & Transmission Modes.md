21. Which topology would fit the organization's needs given the scenario? <br> **Scenario:** A small office with 10 computers needs a simple and cost-effective network. They want to ensure that if one computer fails, it does not affect the others.
     1. Bus Topology
     2. Star Topology
     3. Ring Topology
     4. Tree Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A star topology is the best choice for this small office network because it is simple, cost effective, and offers strong fault isolation. In a star setup, each of the 10 computers connects directly to a central switch. This means if one computer or its cable fails, the rest of the network remains unaffected, ensuring continued operation for other users. The layout is easy to manage and expand, making it ideal for small networks. Additionally, the required hardware, mainly a switch and Ethernet cables, is affordable, making it a practical solution for a small office environment.

22. Which topology would fit the organization's needs given the scenario below? <br> **Scenario:** A computer company has multiple departments with each department needing to connect to a central network, and they want to ensure easy expansion with a clear structure.
     1. Tree Topology
     2. Ring Topology
     3. Hybrid Topology
     4. Bus Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A tree (also known as hierarchical star topology) is the best choice for this computer company because it provides a clear and organized structure that supports easy expansion. In this setup, each department connects to its own switch, and those switches connect to a central core switch that manages overall network traffic. This layout keeps departments logically separated while still maintaining central connectivity. It also simplifies troubleshooting and makes it easy to add new departments or devices without disrupting the rest of the network. The structured design ensures scalability and maintainability as the company grows.

23. Which topology would fit the organization's needs given the scenario below? <br> **Scenario:** A data center requires a network where each node can communicate with every other node directly, and the network must support high data transfer rates with minimal disruption if a single connection fails.with a clear structure.
     1. Star Topology
     2. Ring Topology
     3. Bus Topology
     4. Mesh Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A mesh topology is the best choice for this data center because it allows each node to connect directly to every other node, ensuring fast and reliable communication. This setup supports high data transfer rates and provides excellent redundancy. If one connection fails, data can still travel through other available paths without disrupting network operations. This high level of fault tolerance and direct communication between nodes makes mesh topology ideal for environments like data centers where performance and reliability are critical.

24. Which topology would fit the organization's needs given the scenario below? <br> **Scenario:** A large manufacturing facility consists of multiple departments such as assembly, quality control, logistics, and administration, each with unique network needs. The assembly line requires high-speed, low-latency communication for real-time automation and sensors (best served by a mesh setup). The logistics area spans a long distance and has fewer devices that only occasionally transmit data, making a bus setup more cost effective. The administration offices need structured and scalable access to centralized resources like file servers and printers (best served by a star setup). The facility must also support easy expansion, isolate faults, and maintain high availability without disrupting production.
     1. Ring Topology
     2. Star Topology
     3. Hybrid Topology
     4. Tree Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A hybrid topology is the best choice for this manufacturing facility because it combines the strengths of multiple network designs to meet the unique needs of each department. The assembly line benefits from a mesh topology that provides high-speed, low-latency communication and redundancy for real-time automation. The logistics area, which covers a wide area with minimal data traffic, is well served by a bus topology that keeps costs low and installation simple. The administration offices require a star topology for reliable, centralized access to shared resources like printers and servers. By integrating these topologies into one hybrid network, the facility gains flexibility, fault isolation, and scalability, all while maintaining high availability. This approach ensures that each part of the facility is optimized for performance, cost, and reliability, making hybrid topology the most practical and efficient solution.

25. Which two topologies would you combine to fit the organizations needs given the scenario below? <br> **Scenario:** A manufacturing facility needs a network that is reliable and can connect multiple devices spread across different sections of the building while allowing for easy reconfiguration and expansion.
     1. Star Topology
     2. Bus Topology
     3. Mesh Topology
     4. Tree Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The best approach for this manufacturing facility is to combine star and bus topologies to create a hybrid network that meets the organization's needs for reliability, coverage, and flexibility. A star topology can be used in central areas such as administrative offices or control rooms, where reliable, structured access to shared resources and easy fault isolation are important. Meanwhile, a bus topology is ideal for connecting devices in spread-out sections of the facility, such as warehouses or storage areas, where communication is less frequent and cost efficiency is a priority. This hybrid setup allows the facility to maintain a dependable network while supporting easy reconfiguration and expansion across different parts of the building.

26. Which topology would fit the organization's needs given the scenario below? <br> **Scenario:** A small manufacturing plant has a series of programmable logic controllers (PLCs) and monitoring systems arranged along a production line. These devices need to communicate in a fixed, sequential order to monitor and control automated machinery. The network must maintain a consistent flow of data and avoid collisions but doesn’t require high-speed, real-time communication between all nodes. The system operates in a closed loop, and uptime is important, but cost and simplicity are also key concerns.
     1. Ring Topology
     2. Star Topology
     3. Tree Topology
     4. Mesh Topology
<details closed>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A ring topology is best suited for structured, linear systems like small industrial control networks or legacy networks that benefit from orderly, collision-free communication. It’s not ideal for dynamic, high-speed environments, but it excels when communication is sequential, predictable, and moderately fault tolerant.
