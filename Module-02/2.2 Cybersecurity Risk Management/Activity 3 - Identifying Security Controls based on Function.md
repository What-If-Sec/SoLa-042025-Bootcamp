## Activity Objectives

The objective of this exercise is to enhance your understanding of security controls and their functions within the context of cybersecurity by categorizing controls according to their type (administrative, technical, or physical) and function (preventative, deterrent, detective, corrective, and compensating).

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:

Differentiate between administrative, technical, and physical security controls.Classify security controls based on their primary functions as preventative, deterrent, detective, corrective, or compensating measures.Analyze real-world scenarios to identify the most appropriate type and function of security controls to address specific security threats.Evaluate the effectiveness of selected security controls in mitigating potential risks and vulnerabilities.



## Activity Instructions

Complete the knowledge check to build your understanding of the different types of security controls and their functions.



#### Example

##### Scenario: 
IT Solutions, a mid-sized tech company, recently experienced a security breach where an attacker compromised an employee's credentials through a successful phishing email. Using these credentials, the attacker gained initial access to the internal network and attempted to move laterally to gather more information about the infrastructure and locate sensitive data.

However, during the lateral movement, the company deploys the Snort tool which detected unusual network traffic patterns originating from the compromised account. The IDS flagged this activity and generated an alert, prompting the security team to investigate. The alert revealed attempts to access systems outside of the compromised user's typical behavior profile, which raised further suspicions.

##### Options:

A. Technical Preventative Control

B. Technical Compensating Control

C. Technical Deterrent Control

D. Technical Detective Control



Analysis to answer this question:

<ol>
  <li> Conduct research on what on what "Snort" is using google, looking at the 1st search result, we learned that Snort is a network intrusion detection system (IDS) as well as intrusion prevention system (IPS).
  <li> From reading the scenario, we know that Snort is configured to operate as an intrusion detection system (IDS). So we need to conduct research on what an intrusion detection system (IDS) is.
  <li> From the research conducted, we can determine that the security control being used is a "<b>technical detective control</b>" as Snort is software-based and because Snort is operating as an IDS, so its role is to detect and alert on potential security incidents.
</ol>

### Knowledge Check
1.	In a multinational financial institution, access to sensitive customer financial data is managed through a complex system of access controls. Employees are granted access permissions based on their job roles and responsibilities to ensure that only authorized individuals can view or modify sensitive information.
<br><br> However, over time, the organization's workforce has undergone significant changes due to promotions, transfers, and departures. As a result, the company implements a policy and procedure to encourage access control reviews and auditing to mitigate against a growing concern that access permissions may not be aligned with an employees' current job role and responsibility, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.<br><br> What is the control type and function being implemented? <br>

2.	At a highly classified government facility responsible for top-secret missions, stringent security measures are in place to protect sensitive information and assets. However, one persistent security concern is the risk of tailgating, where unauthorized individuals gain access to secure areas by following closely behind authorized personnel through access-controlled entry points.
<br><br> To address this concern, the security team at the facility places security signage and notices to encourage a healthy security culture.<br><br>

3.	A newly established startup in the technology sector specializing in developing cutting-edge software solutions for artificial intelligence applications gains traction and begins to attract attention in the industry. Prior to launch there are concerns about protecting their intellectual property (IP) and sensitive data. With valuable proprietary algorithms, research data, and confidential client information stored on their internal servers, the founders recognize the critical importance of safeguarding their assets from cyber threats. Thus, they decide to deploy a firewall.<br><br>
