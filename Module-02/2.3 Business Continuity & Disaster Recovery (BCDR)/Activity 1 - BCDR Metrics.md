## Activity Objective

The objective of this activity is to enable students to use MTD (Maximum Tolerable Downtime), RTO (Recovery Time Objective), and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) to calculate the WRT (Work Recovery Time) in a business continuity and disaster recovery context. 

Students will analyze a simulated disruption scenario, apply these recovery metrics to assess the downtime and data loss tolerance, and calculate the time required to restore normal business operations. 

This exercise will help students develop a deeper understanding of how recovery objectives interrelate and how to apply them to create effective recovery strategies.

## Activity Instructions

Calculate the work recovery time (WRT) for each scenario.

#### Remember That...

Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD).  The MTD represents the total amount of time leaders/managers are willing to accept for a mission/business process outage or disruption and includes all impact considerations.  Determining MTD is important because it could leave continuity planners with imprecise direction on (1) selection of an appropriate recovery method, and (2) the depth of detail which will be required when developing recovery procedures, including their scope and content. 
<br><br> Recovery Time Objective (RTO).  RTO defines the maximum amount of time that a system resource can remain unavailable before there is an unacceptable impact on other system resources, supported mission/business processes, and the MTD.  Determining the information system resource RTO is important for selecting appropriate technologies that are best suited for meeting the MTD.
<br><br> Recovery Point Objective (RPO).  The RPO represents the point in time, prior to a disruption or system outage, to which mission/business process data must be recovered (given the most recent backup copy of the data) after an outage.   

### Activity Scenarios
1.	A clothing company operates on an online retail platform. If the website goes down, customers cannot make purchases, resulting in immediate revenue loss. The management has determined that the maximum tolerable downtime is 2 hours. The recovery time objective is set at 30 minutes.
    1.	.5 hr
    2.	1 hr
    3.	1.5 hrs
    4.	2 hrs

2.	A hospital relies heavily on its electronic medical records system for patient care. In the event of a system failure, patient care could be compromised, leading to potential legal liabilities. The hospital's maximum tolerable downtime is 4 hours, and the recovery time objective is 1 hour.
    1.	1 hr
    2.	2 hrs
    3.	3 hrs
    4.	4 hrs

3.	WIS University uses an online learning management system for course delivery and student assessments. Any disruption to the system could affect the academic progress of students. The university has determined that the maximum tolerable downtime is 90 minutes, and the recovery time objective is 20 minutes.
    1.	1 hr 10 mins
    2.	1 hr 20 mins
    3.	1 hr 30 mins
    4.	1 hr 40 mins
