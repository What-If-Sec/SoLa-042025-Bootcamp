## Activity Objective

The objective of this activity is to enable students to analyze and address the potential impact of a catastrophic event on a business by developing a disaster recovery plan. Students will assess the business consequences of a selected disaster, define the main objectives of the recovery plan, perform a Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and recommend an appropriate recovery strategy. 

This activity will help students apply their knowledge of disaster recovery and business continuity principles to real-world scenarios, enhancing their preparedness for roles in cybersecurity and IT management.



## Activity Instructions

In this activity, you'll develop a high-level DR plan for iTech Corp. The plan should focus on the network and technology domains of the business, and be designed for situations where the business suffers a catastrophic incident that must be contained before operations can continue.

To complete this activity you will:

1. Select a catastrophic event for iTech Corp to face such as a fire, flood, a ransomware attack, network outage, DoS attack, terrorist attack, etc.
2. Write a policy statement (1-2 paragraphs) detailing how the business would be affected in the event of the disaster and what the main objectives of the plan are.
3. Perform a BIA (be creative using what you know about iTech below).
4. Submit a draft policy and identify a recovery strategy for iTech i.e. use of recovery sites, backups, etc. and explain what security or IT risk implementing this strategy will mitigate.

#### Note: It is up to you to determine which pieces of information are relevant for your plan, be creative and make assumptions.
