## Activity Objectives:

Students will configure and run a vulnerability scan using Nessus Essentials against a Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) container hosted on their Ubuntu Server. By completing this activity, they will learn how to identify, interpret, and prioritize vulnerabilities reported by Nessus, while gaining hands-on experience with vulnerability scanning tools used in real-world cybersecurity operations.

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:
1. Set up a vulnerability scanning environment by ensuring Nessus Essentials is active and DVWA is running inside a container on their Ubuntu Server.
2. Configure and launch a basic Nessus scan targeting the DVWA container’s IP address.
3. Interpret Nessus scan results by recognizing the severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational).
4. Identify example vulnerabilities in the DVWA container and describe their potential security impact.
5. Explain the role of vulnerability scanning in a broader cybersecurity workflow, including patching and risk management.



## Activity Instructions:
Log into your Red Team VM and complete the tasks below.
> Note: It takes a while for the Nessus plugins to finish compiling/ installing. During this time Nessus functionality will be limited. If you did not complete the pre-work prior to the start of class you will not be able to complete this activity until compilation is completed.

1. Log into your Red Team VM and start your Nessus Scanner  (if you have not done so), then access it by going to https://Red_Team_VM_IP:8834/.
2. Log into your Blue Team VM or Azure Cloud Environment and start your docker DVWA container.
3. Go to the  My Scans Folder and then select "New Scan".Select the "Web Application Tests" Scan template and provide a name, description, as well as your Blue Team VM's IP including port as the target, and save.
4. Go to My Scans and slect the scan you created, then launch the scan.
5. Once the Scan is completed go to the vulnerabilities section and click each vulnerability to find out more information.
6. Complete the quiz below to answer reflection questions.

### Reflection Questions
1. What is the primary purpose of a vulnerability scanner?
    1. To exploit vulnerabilities in a network
    2. To detect and identify potential security weaknesses
    3. To block all unauthorized access automatically
    4. To perform penetration testing without human input
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Vulnerability scanners are designed to find and report security weaknesses (like outdated software, missing patches, or misconfigurations). They don’t block attacks or exploit vulnerabilities — they simply help security teams see what could be exploited so issues can be fixed.
  </p>
</details>

2. Why are vulnerability scanners important in modern organizations? (Select all that apply)
    1. They reduce the need for manual security checks.
    2. They help prioritize risks by severity.
    3. They eliminate the need for firewalls and antivirus software.
    4. They provide reports for audits and compliance requirements.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Scanners save time and reduce human error by automating checks. They also prioritize risks (critical vs. low severity), helping teams focus on the biggest threats first. Reports generated are useful for audits, compliance, and management reviews. However, scanners don’t replace other security tools like firewalls or antivirus — they complement them.
  </p>
</details>

3. Within the scan, vulnerabilities were identified as Critical, High, Medium, etc., what does this information represent in the report?
    1. The scanner's confidence that the finding is not a false positive.
    2. The severity of the vulnerability tied to its CVSS score.
    3. The category of vulnerability based on the Nessus plugin that detected it.
    4. The age of the vulnerability since it was first disclosed.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Severity labels (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info) in Nessus map to CVSS-based severity ranges and indicate the relative severity and potential impact of the vulnerability if exploited. The other options are plausible things to report, but they are not what the severity label specifically represents.
  </p>
</details>

4. Nessus flags a vulnerability with a CVSS base score of 9.8. What does this tell you?
    1. It’s a low-priority vulnerability
    2. It’s not of any concern and is informational only
    3. It’s a high-priority vulnerability that should be remediated quickly
    4. It’s priority is not critical, and can be addressed later.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    A 9.8 score is considered Critical, which is the highest severity band (9.0–10.0). This informs you that this vulnerability could be serious and pose a high risk of exploitation resulting in the attacker gaining full control of the victim's system. Findings with this rating would be patched, mitigated, or isolated immediately before addressing lower severity findings.
  </p>
</details>

5. Which of the following are benefits of using vulnerability scanners? (Select all that apply)
    1. Automating the detection of common vulnerabilities.
    2. Providing instant fixes without administrator involvement.
    3. Ensuring compliance with security standards.
    4. Identifying misconfigurations in systems and applications.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Scanners save time by automating vulnerability detection and help organizations meet compliance frameworks like PCI-DSS or HIPAA. They also detect misconfigurations such as weak passwords or open ports. However, scanners do not fix issues automatically — remediation still requires administrators.
  </p>
</details>

6. At times, as a reference Nessus will provide either CWE or CVE information. What is the difference between CWE and CVE?
    1. CVE lists specific publicly known vulnerabilities, while CWE describes general weakness categories.
    2. CWE lists specific publicly known vulnerabilities, while CVE describes general weakness categories.
    3. CWE and CVE are the same thing, just different naming conventions.
    4. Both CWE and CVE are vendor-specific vulnerability databases.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    CVE entries are IDs for specific vulnerabilities in software/hardware (e.g., CVE-2023-12345). CWE describes types of weaknesses (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection) that could lead to vulnerabilities.
  </p>
</details>

7. Which statements are true about CWE? (Select all that apply)
    1. CWE helps developers understand types of coding errors that can lead to vulnerabilities.
    2. CWE lists individual publicly known vulnerabilities.
    3. CWE is useful for building secure coding practices and training developers.
    4. CWE assigns IDs to threats discovered in the wild.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    CWE focuses on generalized weakness types (like SQL injection, buffer overflow) rather than individual instances. It helps teams understand and prevent vulnerabilities before they occur.
  </p>
</details>

8. Which statements are true about CVE? (Select all that apply)
    1. CVE provides a reference number for specific vulnerabilities.
    2. CVE helps organizations track and patch known issues.
    3. CVE describes broad categories of threats.
    4. CVE is primarily for training developers in secure coding practices.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    CWE focuses on generalized weakness types (like SQL injection, buffer overflow) rather than individual instances. It helps teams understand and prevent vulnerabilities before they occur.
  </p>
</details>

9. Why is it important for cybersecurity professionals to be familiar with both CWE and CVE?
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    CVE helps IT & security professionals patch specific vulnerabilities, while CWE provides insight into why the vulnerabilities happen. Knowing both allows teams to protect against current threats and prevent future ones.
  </p>
</details>

10. Which statements are true about CVE? (Select all that apply)
    1. Scan the internet for systems matching known CVE IDs to find unpatched targets.
    2. Map CWE weakness patterns to identify likely attack vectors against an application type.
    3. Use CVE and CWE details to craft targeted social engineering or supply chain attacks.
    4. Correlate CVE data with exploit code published online to launch attacks more efficiently
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary>
  <p>
    Public vulnerability and weakness information can be used by attackers to prioritize and find targets. That means defenders must assume attackers also read CVE and CWE data, and plan accordingly. As a result, defenders should: keep systems patched and inventoried, apply least privilege where possible, secure system, app, etc. configurations, as well as monitor for exploitation indicators while practicing responsible disclosure and coordinated patch timelines.
