#3 Activity Objective:

Students will exploit the file upload vulnerability found within Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) to simulate the exploitation phase of a penetration test. By the end of the activity, students will be able to:
1. Explain the purpose and significance of the exploitation phase in the penetration testing process.
2. Recognize the characteristics of the file upload vulnerability within DVWA and its potential security implications.
3. Demonstrate the steps to successfully exploit the file upload vulnerability, including crafting and uploading a malicious file to the application.
4. Evaluate the consequences of the successful exploitation, discussing potential risks such as remote code execution and data compromise.



## Activity Instructions:

Log into your Kali or Parrot VM and complete the following:
1. Open a browser and go to http://<target_VM_IP>:8080/login.php to access the DVWA application.
2. Log into DVWA entering "admin" as the username and either "admin" or "password" as the password.
3. Once logged in go to  and click "File Upload" on the left-hand panel.
4. Identify and exploit the vulnerability, by reading the following [Acunetix blog post](https://www.acunetix.com/websitesecurity/upload-forms-threat/).

  <p>
   If a web app accepts a file upload and the server later executes or serves that file as code (for example rendering it as HTML or running it as PHP), any code inside the file will be executed. In this example the uploaded file contains a <code><script></code> tag with <code>alert('App is Vulnerable')</code>, so when the server serves that file from the app’s origin the browser parses the page and runs the script. This matters because code that is executed in the app origin can access cookies and local storage, hijack the user’s session, or perform other harmful actions.

    Content of HTML file uploaded:
  </p> 
  <pre><code>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      alert('App is Vulnerable')
    &lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
