  <code>cat Admin_logA.txt Admin_logB.txt > combined_logs.txt</code>
</details>

3. Use the ```sed``` command to normalize "failed logins" by replacing all instances of INCORRECT_PASSWORD with ACCESS_DENIED so that the data is consistent, and save the output in a new file called updated_combined_logs.txt.
