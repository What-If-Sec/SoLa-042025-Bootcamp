## Activity Objective

Students will be able to define and identify key characteristics of common cyber attacks, including phishing, malware, denial-of-service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MitM)/ on-path attacks, and SQL injection. By the end of the activity, students will understand the significance of these attacks in the cybersecurity landscape and recognize why foundational knowledge of these threats is crucial. This knowledge will equip you with the awareness needed to identify potential vulnerabilities and strengthen your preparedness for understanding more advanced security practices, tactics, techniques, and procedures.

## Activity Instruction
In this activity, students will check their knowledge by answer multiple-choice questions to test your understanding of common cyber attacks, including phishing, malware, denial-of-service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MitM), and SQL injection. Each question will present a scenario or description, and you will select the correct attack type based on the information provided.

> Reminder: This activity is designed to reinforce your foundational knowledge of cyber attacks and help you recognize different threat types in real-world contexts. Pay close attention to the distinguishing characteristics in each question to make informed choices.
