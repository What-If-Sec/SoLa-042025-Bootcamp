## Activity Objective(s)
The objective of this activity is to enhance students' understanding of cybersecurity concepts through practical application. By analyzing a simulated cyber-attack scenario, students will develop skills in identifying threat actors, targeted assets, specific threats, exploited vulnerabilities, and associated security risks. Additionally, students will collaborate within groups to devise and recommend effective security controls to mitigate each identified issue.

## Activity Instruction(s)
1.	Analyze the attack scenario, conduct research (using google), and identify:
    - The asset being attacked,
    -	The attack vector,
    -	The potential threat actor,
    -	The inherent security risk due to the threat actor exploiting the vulnerability,
    -	The cyber threat,
    -	The Cyber Attack
    -	The vulnerability being exploited,  and
    -	Security control(s) to mitigate the security risk or prevent the attack

2. Once your analysis is completed, submit within EducateMe.

**Example Scenario:** 

The IT team for a website of a popular political figure forget to limit the rate of traffic that reaches their web servers and forget to distribute this web traffic across multiple servers. This leads to the website becoming unavailable for several hours due to an overwhelming volume of incoming traffic.

**Example Analysis:**
-	Asset: Politician’s Website 
-	Attack Vector: The Internet (Public Network)
-	Potential Threat Actor(s): Hacktivists, Nation-State, Thrill Seeker
-	Security Risk: Damage to reputation of politician, voters don’t know politician’s policies.
-	Cyber Threat: Website Crashing
-	Cyber Attack: DoS Attack
-	Vulnerability: Lack of load balancing and rate limiting
-	Security Control(s): Load balancing, rate limiting, IP blocking, and firewall

## Activity Scenario
An individual posing as an IT support technician calls employees of a company, claiming there is a security issue with their accounts and asks them information about their account and their account's activity. Within the conversation, the indivdual asks for the employees password and they provide it.
