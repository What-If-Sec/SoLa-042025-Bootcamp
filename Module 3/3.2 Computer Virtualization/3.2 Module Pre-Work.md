## Pre-Work Instructions (Virtual Only)

In addition to the instructions above, since you are participating in the course virtually, within this up incoming module you will not be able to join us for the in-person, hands-on activity of physically disassembling and re-building a PC. However, to ensure you gain the same foundational experience and understanding of PC hardware components and assembly, you will be using the PC Building Simulator game as an alternative.

The PC Building Simulator cost $19.99 and can be downloaded from the Steam store: https://store.steampowered.com/app/621060/PC_Building_Simulator/
