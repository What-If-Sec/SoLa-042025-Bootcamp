## Activity Objectives
By the end of this activity, students will be able to accurately assess and categorize various technical issues into the appropriate level of tech support needed, based on predefined support levels. Students will analyze provided scenarios, evaluate the complexity and nature of the issues described, and determine the suitable tech support tier to address each issue effectively. This exercise aims to enhance students' understanding of the different levels of tech support, their functions, and their roles in resolving technical problems efficiently.

## Activity Insructions
Complete the knowledge check below, and determine which level of support is needed to address each IT scenario.

#### Remember that...

L0 - Self help

At this level, users can retrieve support information themselves, typically involving minimal assistance from an IT professional. This involves running search queries, pulling information from websites, FAQs, technical manuals, blog posts, app pages, service catalogs, knowledge base articles, and potentially even chatbots.

 L1 – Help Desk/ Service Desk

This is the first line in direct support, these are your helpdesk operators, IT call desk support, etc. that interact through the phone or web with customers and provide support for basic issues, known problems, and service requests.

L2 – Technical Support

Level-two technical IT support will have more in-depth, specialized knowledge and experience with the product or service that aligns with the incident. They are most likely to be Second-Line Support Engineers, Customer Support Technicians, and Desktop Support Analysts. Typically, the incidents addressed at this level require more technical expertise.

Level 3 – Expert Product and Service Support

This is where the highest technical resources are accessed for incident resolution. These support staff are the most highly skilled product and service specialists, including Network Specialists, Server Engineers, Third-Line Support Engineers, and the engineers, programmers, and even the chief architects who created the product or service. They will attempt to duplicate the problem to define the root cause and issue a new fix. Once the fix is issued, it will be documented for future use by Level-one and -two customer support technicians.

Level 4 – Outside Support

Level four IT support involves preferred vendors and business partners who are contracted from outside the organization to provide support for items that are not directly serviced by the organization. This might include things like printer support, vendor software support, machine maintenance, and depot support.
