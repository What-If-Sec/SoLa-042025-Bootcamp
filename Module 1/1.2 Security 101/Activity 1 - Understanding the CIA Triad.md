## Activity Objective(s)
The objective of this activity is to help students understand the fundamental principles of cybersecurity encapsulated in the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). By engaging in this activity, students will gain a deeper understanding of how these principles are applied in real-world cybersecurity practices.
Remember that...
- Confidentiality: Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized individuals or entities.
- Integrity: Ensures the accuracy, completeness, and trustworthiness of information and systems.
- Availability: Ensures that information and resources are accessible and usable when needed by authorized users.
