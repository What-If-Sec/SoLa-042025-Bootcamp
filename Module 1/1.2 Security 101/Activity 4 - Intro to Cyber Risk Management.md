## Activity Objective
Understanding how security controls mitigate, avoid, accept, or transfer risks is essential for developing effective cybersecurity strategies. By analyzing real-world scenarios, you will learn to assess how different security controls can influence risk management decisions, ultimately ensuring that systems, data, and operations are protected against potential threats while balancing organizational priorities. This activity will enhance your ability to make informed decisions about which security controls to implement based on the level of risk and the resources available to your organization.

## Activity Instructions
1. Read each attack scenario carefully.
2. For each scenario, select the correct response (mitigate, avoid, accept, or transfer) based on how the listed security control would manage the risk.
3. Provide a brief explanation for your choice.

### Activity Scenarios
1. A user receives an email that appears to come from a legitimate source, asking them to click on a link and enter their login credentials. The email leads to a malicious site that steals the user's information. To address this risk, the company implements email filtering to block malicious emails and conducts user awareness training to help employees identify phishing attempts.

2. A company suffers a data breach involving customer information, which leads to legal action and financial penalties due to non-compliance with data protection regulations. To manage this risk, the company purchases cyber insurance and ensures compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) to minimize financial losses and legal repercussions.

3. A small startup company is using cloud storage to store customer data. The company is aware that there is a potential risk of a data breach due to a vulnerability in the cloud provider’s platform, but the likelihood of an attack is low. Additionally, the company cannot afford to invest in additional security measures, such as enhanced encryption services, due to budget constraints. After carefully evaluating the situation, the company decides that the cost of additional security measures exceeds the potential impact of a data breach, given the company’s size and risk profile.

4.  A financial institution is developing a mobile banking app that will handle sensitive customer information, including bank account details and credit card numbers. During the development process, the security team identifies a vulnerability in the app's authentication feature that could allow attackers to bypass security measures. The development team faces a tight deadline but has the option to deploy the app with this vulnerability or delay the release to address the issue. Recognizing the critical nature of financial data, the company decides to postpone the app’s launch until the authentication feature is fully secured.
