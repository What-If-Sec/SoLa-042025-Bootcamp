## Activity Objectives

Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of file and group ownership in Linux systems by utilizing the su command to switch between user contexts, creating files for each user on their Linux virtual machine (VM), and then testing access permissions based on ownership. Through the use of the chown and chgrp commands, students will adjust file and group ownership to ensure access to files, thereby enhancing their proficiency in managing file permissions and ownership.

Through this exercise students will:
1. Gain understanding of the significance of file and group ownership in Linux systems.
2. Build proficiency in using the su command to switch between user contexts and test access permissions.
3. Gather hands-on experience in creating files for each user and adjusting file and group ownership using the chown and chgrp commands.
4. Grow the ability to analyze access controls and implement ownership management strategies effectively.

## Activity Instructions

Prior to starting the knowledge check below complete the following tasks:
1. Open your terminal and use the su command to switch to Rosie.
2. On Rosie's desktop directory create a file titled "RosiesScript.sh" using the touch command.
3. echo the text "#!/bin/bash" to the RosiesScript.sh file.echo the text "ls -l"Â  and append it to the RosiesScript.sh file.
4. Change the file permissions for RosiesScript.sh to read, write, and execute, for the group and user, and read only for others using the chmod command.
5. Change the group ownership of RosiesScript.sh to the developer group using the chown command.
6. Use the su command to switch to Virgil.On Virgil's desktop directory create a file titled "PR-Strategy.txt" with the touch command.
7. echo the text "Cut costs, increase revenue" to the PR-Strategy.txt file.
8. Change the file permissions for PR-Strategy.txt to read and write for the user, read for the group, and no permissions for others using the chmod command.
