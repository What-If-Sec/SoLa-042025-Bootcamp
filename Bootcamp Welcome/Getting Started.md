## Welcome to the SoLa Cybersecurity Bootcamp!

Welcome, students! We’re excited to have you join us on this journey through cybersecurity. To get started, please follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Watch the Git Video

Before diving into the course materials, it’s essential to understand the basics of Git, GitLab, and GitHub. Watch the video explaining these concepts [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpISo9TNjfU). This will provide you with the foundational knowledge needed for the course.

### Step 2: Access the Course Syllabus

You’ll find the course syllabus in EducateMe.

### Step 4: Course Schedule & Preparation

Each module's lecture materials, supplemental readings, and YouTube videos will open 3 days before the class date within EducateMe, and answers to assignments and knowledge checks will be posted the day of class. 

### Stay On Track

Make sure to complete any pre-class activities and review all (if not most) of the available supplemental readings and YouTube videos available, and be ready to participate in class discussions. We encourage proactive learning, and reviewing materials ahead of time will help you get the most out of each class. Remember, you are entering a new industry and acquiring new skills, this course will take dedication to learn the material, gain the experience you need, and be successful.

If you have any questions or need support, don't hesitate to reach out. We’re here to help!

Let’s get started on this exciting cybersecurity journey!

Best,
