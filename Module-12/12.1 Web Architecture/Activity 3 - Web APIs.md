## Activity Objective

Students will demonstrate their understanding of web APIs by completing a quiz that assesses their knowledge of different types of APIs, including RESTful, SOAP, GraphQL, WebSocket, and others. The quiz aims to reinforce concepts such as API functionality, communication methods, and appropriate use cases for each API type. By the end of this activity, students will be able to differentiate between various APIs, understand their roles in software development, and apply this knowledge to real-world scenarios involving API integration and implementation.



## Activity Instructions

For this quiz conduct research on RESTful, SOAP, GraphQL, and WebSocket APIs, then complete the quiz.

### Knowledge Check
1. In a microservices architecture, how do services typically communicate with each other?
    1. Directly via method calls
    2. Through a shared database
    3. Over RESTful APIs or messaging queues
    4. Using file storage
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>In a microservices architecture, services typically communicate with each other by using lightweight communication methods such as RESTful APIs or messaging systems. This approach allows each service to stay independent while still sharing data and coordinating actions with other services.</p></details>

2. Which of the following is a type of web API that follows REST architectural principles?
    1. SOAP API
    2. RESTful API
    3. GraphQL API
    4. RPC API
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>The type of web API that follows REST architectural principles is the RESTful API. It uses standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE, and organizes resources with URLs, making it simple, scalable, and widely used for web services.</p></details>

3. What is a primary advantage of using RESTful APIs?
    1. They are platform-independent and use standard HTTP methods.
    2. They require a complex setup.
    3. They are faster than other types of APIs.
    4. They support data formats like JSON or XML.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>A primary advantage of using RESTful APIs is that they use standard HTTP methods and are easy to integrate across platforms. This makes them flexible, widely supported, and well-suited for communication between different systems and applications.</p></details>

4. Which type of API allows clients to request only the specific data they need, potentially reducing the amount of data transferred?
    1. SOAP API
    2. GraphQL API
    3. RESTful API
    4. WebSocket API
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>The type of API that allows clients to request only the specific data they need is GraphQL. With GraphQL, clients can define the exact fields and data structures they want, which helps avoid over-fetching or under-fetching information and can make applications more efficient.</p></details>

5. What protocol do most web APIs use for communication?
    1. SSH
    2. FTP/ SFTP
    3. ICMP
    4. HTTP/ HTTPS
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>Most web APIs use the HTTP/HTTPS protocol for communication. HTTP provides the basic structure for sending requests and receiving responses, while HTTPS adds encryption for secure communication between clients and servers.</p></details>

6. In the context of APIs, what does CRUD stand for?
    1. Create, Read, Update, Delete
    2. Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
    3. Create, Read, Upload, Download
    4. Create, Read, Update, Destroy
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>In the context of APIs, CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic operations used to interact with resources in many web applications, often mapped to HTTP methods like POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE.</p></details>

7. What is the purpose of an API key?
    1. To encrypt data being transferred
    2. To uniquely identify and authenticate a client to the API
    3. To format the API response
    4. To store session data
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>The purpose of an API key is to authenticate and identify the client making API requests. This helps control access to the API, track usage, and protect the system from unauthorized or excessive requests.</p></details>

8. Which type of API uses XML as its messaging format and operates over HTTP?
    1. RESTful API
    2. GraphQL API
    3. SOAP API
    4. WebSocket API
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>The type of API that uses XML as its messaging format and operates over HTTP is SOAP API. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) relies on XML for requests and responses, and while it is more rigid than REST, it provides built-in standards for security and error handling.</p></details>

9. What is an advantage of using WebSocket APIs compared to traditional REST APIs?
    1. They are easier to implement.
    2. They use less bandwidth.
    3. They are more secure by default.
    4. They allow for real-time, two-way communication.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>An advantage of using WebSocket APIs compared to traditional REST APIs is that they allow real-time two-way communication between client and server. This makes them ideal for applications like chat, gaming, or live updates where instant data exchange is needed.</p></details>

10. Which of the following statements is true regarding open APIs?
    1. They are not publicly available for developers to use.
    2. They require special permissions to access.
    3. They are publicly available for developers to use.
    4.  They cannot be modified by users.
<details closed> <summary>Answer</summary><p>The true statement regarding open APIs is that they are publicly available for external developers to use. Open APIs allow outside developers to access certain features or data of an application, encouraging innovation and integration with other systems.</p></details>
