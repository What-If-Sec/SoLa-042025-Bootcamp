## Activity Objective

Students will gain a comprehensive understanding of **Windows Task Manager** and **Resource Monitor**, learning how these tools are used by system administrators to monitor and manage system performance, diagnose issues, and optimize system resources.
Through this activity, students will be able to:

- Identify and explain the main functions and components of the Windows Task Manager and Resource Monitor.
- Use the Windows Task Manager to monitor real-time system performance, including CPU, memory, disk, and network usage.
- Use the Windows Resource Monitor to perform more detailed analysis of system resources and performance.
- Identify processes that are consuming excessive resources and determine appropriate actions to resolve performance bottlenecks.
- Understand how to use these tools to optimize system performance by managing startup programs, ending unresponsive tasks, and prioritizing processes.
