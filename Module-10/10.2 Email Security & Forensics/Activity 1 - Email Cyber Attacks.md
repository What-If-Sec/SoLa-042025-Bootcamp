### Knowledge Check
1. What type of attack involves an email that pretends to be from a trusted source to trick a recipient into providing login credentials?
    1.	Spam
    2.	Phishing
    3.	On-Path Attack
    4.	Email Bombing
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is known as phishing. In a phishing attack, the attacker sends an email that looks like it comes from a trusted source such as a bank, a company, or even a coworker. The goal is to trick the recipient into clicking a malicious link or providing sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card numbers. Because the email appears to be legitimate, unsuspecting users may give away their credentials, which can then be used for unauthorized access or identity theft.
  </p>

2. Which attack involves sending a high volume of emails to overwhelm a target’s inbox, making it unusable?
    1.	Spear Phishing
    2.	Spam
    3.	Email Bombing
    4.	Whaling
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is called an email bombing attack. In an email bombing attack, an attacker floods the target’s inbox with a massive number of emails in a short period of time. The goal is to overwhelm the mailbox, making it difficult or impossible for the victim to find legitimate messages or even access their inbox. This can disrupt communication, cause denial of service, and force the victim to spend time and effort cleaning out their email.

3. A personalized email that targets a company’s CEO in order to steal financial information is an example of?
    1.	Whaling
    2.	Spam
    3.	Business Email Compromise (BEC)
    4.	Malware
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is known as whaling. Whaling is a form of phishing that specifically targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as CEOs, CFOs, or other executives. The attacker crafts a personalized and convincing message that often appears to involve urgent financial matters or sensitive business information. Because executives typically have access to valuable data and authority over financial transactions, whaling attacks can be especially damaging if successful.
  </p>
</details>

4. An email pointing to a fake login page that resembles a bank's legitimate website, so that the attacker can capture your credentials is an example of?
    1.	Credential Stuffing via Phishing
    2.	Credential Harvesting via Phishing
    3.	Credential Stuffing via BEC
    4.	Credential Harvesting via Whaling
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is an example of credential harvesting through phishing. The attacker sends an email with a link to a fake login page that looks almost identical to a legitimate site, such as a bank’s website. When the victim enters their username and password, the attacker captures those details in order to steal their login credentials. This stolen information can then be reused for unauthorized access, identity theft, or financial fraud.
  </p>
</details>

5. Which type of email attack uses fake sender information to trick the recipient into believing the email is from a trusted source?
    1.	Spear Phishing
    2.	IP Spoofing
    3.	DNS Spoofing
    4.	Email Spoofing
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is known as email spoofing. In an email spoofing attack, the attacker forges the sender’s address or other header information so that the message appears to come from a trusted source. The goal is to trick the recipient into opening the email, clicking links, or providing sensitive information. Spoofing is often used as part of broader phishing or credential harvesting campaigns because it increases the likelihood that the victim will trust and act on the fraudulent message.
  </p>
</details>

6. An email that appears to be from a trusted colleague or business partner and requests sensitive information or actions from you is an example of?
    1.	Whaling
    2.	Spear Phishing
    3.	Phishing
    4.	Vishing
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is an example of a spear phishing attack. Unlike general phishing, spear phishing is highly targeted and often customized to look like it is coming from a trusted colleague, supervisor, or business partner. The attacker carefully crafts the message to appear legitimate in order to convince the recipient to share sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data, or to carry out harmful actions like transferring funds. Because the email looks personal and relevant, spear phishing is especially effective at tricking victims.
  </p>
</details>

7. Which type of attack involves an attacker secretly intercepting emails in transit between sender and recipient?
    1.	On-Path Attack
    2.	Email Spoofing
    3.	Phishing
    4.	Email Bombing
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is known as an on-path or man in the middle (MitM) attack. In this attack, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters email messages while they are traveling between the sender and the recipient. Because neither party may realize the communication has been compromised, the attacker can read sensitive information, harvest credentials, or inject malicious content before passing the message along. This makes man in the middle attacks especially dangerous, as they break the confidentiality and integrity of email communication.
  </p>

8. Which type of attack involves a targeted attack where an employee is tricked into transferring money or sharing sensitive data via email is called?
    1.	Spam
    2.	Spear Phishing
    3.	Business Email Compromise (BEC)
    4.	Vishing
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This type of attack is known as business email compromise (BEC). In a BEC attack, an attacker targets a specific employee, often someone in finance, payroll, or with access to sensitive data, and tricks them into transferring money, changing payment details, or sharing confidential information. The attacker usually impersonates an executive, vendor, or trusted partner to make the request seem legitimate. Because the emails are highly targeted and convincing, BEC attacks can cause severe financial and data losses for organizations.
  </p>
</details>

9. True or False: Spear phishing is a type of phishing attack that targets specific individuals or organizations.
    1.	True
    2.	False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
True. Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing where attackers craft personalized emails aimed at specific individuals or organizations. Unlike general phishing attacks that cast a wide net, spear phishing uses details such as names, job roles, or company information to make the email appear more credible. This personalization increases the chances of tricking the recipient into clicking malicious links, opening infected attachments, or providing sensitive information.
  </p>
</details>

10. True or False: Spam emails are often sent in large quantities to distribute malware or collect sensitive information.
    1.	True
    2.	False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
True. Spam emails are unsolicited messages that are usually sent in bulk to a large number of recipients. While many spam messages are simply advertisements, attackers often use spam to spread malware through attachments or malicious links, or to collect sensitive information such as login credentials and financial details. Because of their volume and potential risks, spam emails are a common method used in cyberattacks.
  </p>
</details>

11. True or False: Whaling attacks usually target lower-level employees.
    1.	True
    2.	False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
False. Whaling attacks are a specialized type of phishing that focus on high-profile targets such as CEOs, executives, or other senior leaders within an organization. The goal is often to steal financial information, gain access to sensitive data, or trick the executive into authorizing fraudulent transactions. Unlike general phishing or spear phishing, whaling is aimed at the "big fish" in a company, not lower level employees.
  </p>
</details>

12. True or False: Phishing typically refers to bulk emails sent to a large number of recipients, usually for advertising, scams, or other low-target purposes; and are often generic and not personalized.
    1.	True
    2.	False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
False. Spam is usually bulk and generic, often focused on advertising or nuisance messages. Phishing specifically refers to emails designed to deceive recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial data. While phishing can be sent in bulk, its defining characteristic is malicious intent and impersonation, not simply volume or lack of personalization.
  </p>
</details>

13. True or False: BEC is similar to a whaling attack, since both attacks involve targeting executives like CEOs and CFOs.
    1.	True
    2.	False
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
False. While whaling is a form of phishing that specifically targets high-level executives, Business Email Compromise is broader. BEC can target anyone in an organization, including finance staff, HR, or vendors, by impersonating trusted contacts to trick victims into sending money or sensitive data.
  </p>
</details>

14. Which of the following can help reduce spam emails?
    1.	Using SPF, DKIM, and DMARC
    2.	Blocking attachments in all incoming emails
    3.	Configuring spam filters and blacklists
    4.	Encrypting all outgoing emails
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
Spam filters and blacklists are specifically designed to block unsolicited or mass emails. SPF, DKIM, and DMARC help with sender authentication, but filtering directly reduces spam in users’ inboxes.
  </p>
</details>

15. What is one of the best defenses against phishing emails?
    1.	Training users to recognize suspicious links and attachments
    2.	Enabling anti-virus software
    3.	Using email encryption
    4.	Using strong passwords
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
Phishing attacks primarily rely on tricking people into clicking malicious links or sharing sensitive data. While antivirus software, encryption, and strong passwords are important security measures in general, they do not directly stop a user from falling for a phishing email. The most effective defense here is user awareness and training to recognize suspicious links and attachments.
  </p>
</details>

16. Which control is most effective in reducing the risk of Business Email Compromise (BEC)?
    1.	Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)
    2.	Using email signatures in all outgoing emails
    3.	Encrypting all email attachments
    4.	Turning on spam filtering
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
MFA makes it much harder for attackers to gain access to corporate email accounts, even if they steal credentials. Combined with verification policies for financial requests, it is one of the best defenses against BEC.
  </p>
</details>

17. Which measure can help best mitigate the effects of an email bomb attack?
    1.	Training employees to recognize phishing attempts
    2.	Encrypting email messages with TLS
    3.	Configuring spam filters and blacklists
    4.	Limiting mailbox size and configuring rate-limiting on mail servers
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
Email bomb attacks overwhelm inboxes with massive volumes of messages. Rate limiting and mailbox quotas can help mail servers filter and control the flood of traffic, reducing the impact.

18. **Scenario:** You receive a phone call from someone claiming to be from your bank’s fraud department. The caller says there has been suspicious activity on your account and that they need to “verify your identity.” They pressure you to provide your online banking username, password, or even your debit card PIN over the phone so they can “secure your account.

    **Question:** What kind of attack might this be, and what should you do next?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This scenario is an example of vishing because the attacker uses a phone call rather than email to impersonate the bank. By posing as a fraud department representative, the caller creates a sense of urgency about “suspicious activity” and pressures the victim to share sensitive details such as login credentials or a PIN. Unlike legitimate banks, which never request this kind of information over the phone, the attacker exploits trust and fear through voice communication. This makes it vishing, a form of social engineering designed to steal personal or financial information by phone.
  </p>
</details>

19. **Scenario:** An employee in the finance department receives an email that looks like it came directly from the company’s CEO, instructing them to urgently wire money to a “new vendor account” to complete a confidential business deal.

    **Question:** What attack is this? And how should the company respond?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This is an example of a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attack. In this type of attack, cybercriminals impersonate high-level executives or trusted partners to trick employees into transferring money or sharing sensitive data. The correct response would be to avoid acting on the request until it is verified through a known and trusted communication channel, such as directly calling the CEO or confirming with another executive. The incident should also be reported immediately to the security team so that preventive measures can be taken.
  </p>
</details>

20. **Scenario:** You send an email to a client with updated payment instructions. A few hours later, the client replies saying they already received an email from “you” earlier with different bank account details.

    **Question:** What type of attack might this be, and what should you do next?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
This is an example of an email spoofing attack, where an attacker forges the sender’s address to trick the recipient into believing the email is legitimate. In this case, the goal was to redirect payments to the attacker’s account. The proper response would be to alert the client immediately not to follow the false instructions, report the spoofing attempt to your IT or security team, and consider implementing email authentication measures such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to make it harder for attackers to impersonate your domain.
  </p>
</details>

21. **Scenario:** You receive an email that congratulates you for winning a prize, but you never entered any contests. The email asks you to provide your personal details to claim the prize.

    **Question:** What should you suspect and do next?
<details closed>
<summary>Answer Key</summary>
  <p>
You should suspect that the email is spam that is designed to steal your personal information. As a result, you should not click any links, download attachments, or reply with your details. Instead, delete the email immediately or mark it as spam, and if you are unsure, verify directly with the supposed organization through official channels rather than using the contact information provided in the message.
