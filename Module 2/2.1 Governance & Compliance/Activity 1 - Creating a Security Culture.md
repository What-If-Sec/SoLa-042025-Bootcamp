## Activity Objectives:

Students will develop an understanding of security culture and its critical role in preventing data breaches within organizations. Through this activity, students will learn to:

- Define Security Culture: Understand what constitutes a security culture and its importance in organizational behavior and security practices.
- Identify Security Risks: Recognize how a strong security culture can mitigate risks associated with employee behaviors that jeopardize data security.
- Implement Security Practices: Explore methods for fostering a security culture in the workplace, including training, awareness programs, and policy enforcement.
- Evaluate Organizational Readiness: Assess how organizations can evaluate their current security culture and identify areas for improvement to enhance data protection.
- Develop Action Plans: Create actionable strategies for improving security culture in healthcare or other organizational settings, focusing on employee engagement and compliance.
- Measure Effectiveness: Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the success of initiatives aimed at strengthening the organization's security culture.



## Activity Instructions
> Students can work together in teams/ breakout rooms; however, each student is required to submit their own work.

In this exercise you'll be playing the role of a security consultant who has been contracted by the LA Hospital to develop a plan to address the three security risks below.

#### Security Risk #1
Medical staff have been observed leaving their workstations unintended while logged.

#### Security Risk #2
Medical staff have been observed holding the door for others behind them when accessing the building through the employee entrance, without each employee scanning their individual badges.

#### Security Risk #3
Medical staff have been observed clicking on links and attachments from emails from unknown or external sources.

Apply the 6 steps for building a security culture by:

1. Explain the security risks that this behavior introduces?
2. Describe a method for finding out how many members of the medical staff are behaving in an insecure way and how you would track those that do?
3. Set a goal (risk tolerance) for how many employees should engage in this behavior?
4. Set an estimated timeline for each solution?
5. Make an action plan for the solution you feel best addresses the security risk? For example you might recommend to implement training, stricter security controls, or some combination of the two.
6. Explain what key performance indicators (KPIs) you will use to measure and determine if your plan is successful? (i.e. how could you provide evidence that your solution worked?) <br>

> **Tips for Identifying Security Risk:**
> - Brainstorm ideas of what negative "things" could happen due to each scenario.
> - Conduct research on how hospitals have been breached in the past.
