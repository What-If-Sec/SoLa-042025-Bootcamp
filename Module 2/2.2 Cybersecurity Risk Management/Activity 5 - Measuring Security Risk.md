## Activity Objectives

The objective of this exercise is to educate students on how to execute a comprehensive cyber risk assessment using both quantitative and qualitative analysis methods, emphasizing the importance of integrating these approaches to achieve a holistic understanding of cyber risks.

By the end of this activity, students should be able to:
<ol>
  <li>> Understand the concepts of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis in the context of cybersecurity.</li>
  <li> Identify and assess cybersecurity risks using quantitative methods, such as risk scoring, probability calculations, and financial impact analysis.
  <li> Identify and assess cybersecurity risks using qualitative methods, such as risk categorization, threat modeling, and expert judgment.</li> 
  <li> Evaluate the strengths and limitations of quantitative and qualitative risk analysis approaches.Integrate quantitative and qualitative analysis methods to prioritize cybersecurity risks based on their likelihood, impact, and mitigating factors.
  <li> Communicate findings and recommendations effectively to stakeholders, emphasizing the importance of a balanced approach to cyber risk assessment. </li>

  <li> Use the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v4-calculator">CVSS 4 calculator</a> and use the base metrics, exploitability metrics and vulnerable system impact metrics to score each  of the threats you've identified.</li> 
  <li> Within the excel file, delete the example and insert each of the threats you identified, providing the name, threat description, as well as rating and rationale for each metric.</li> 
  <li> Use the spreadsheet to calculate the SLE and ALE for the threats you've identified.  Use AI tools and google to assist you in calculating the value of each asset as well as the ARO, and apply logical reasoning to assess the potential impact of the threat on the asset i.e. the EF. </li>
