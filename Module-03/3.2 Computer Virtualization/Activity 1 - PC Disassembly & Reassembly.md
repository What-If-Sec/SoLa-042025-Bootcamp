## Activity Objective

By the end of these activities, students will be able to:

1. Identify and describe the key components of a PC, including the CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage devices, power supply unit (PSU), graphics card, and peripherals, through participation in a scavenger hunt.
2. Demonstrate the process of building a PC from individual components, including proper handling, installation, and cable management techniques, to assemble a functional system.

Through thisÂ  exercises students will gain both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, providing you with a comprehensive understanding of PC hardware components and assembly procedures.



## Activity Instructions:

In this hands-on workshop, students will have the opportunity to gain practical experience in disassembling and reassembling a PC. Working in small groups, students will dismantle the PCs in front of them, identify each component, and then follow proper assembly procedures to rebuild the PC. This exercise aims to enhance students' understanding of PC hardware components and assembly techniques.

Tasks:

1. Students will be divided into 4-5 groups.
2. Each group will begin by carefully disassembling the PC in front of them, following proper safety precautions.
3. Each group will begin by carefully disassembling the PC in front of them, following proper safety precautions. (https://www.crucial.com/articles/pc-builders/disassemble-and-rebuild-a-desktop-computer).
4. Identify and label each component as it is removed from the PC, including the CPU, motherboard, RAM, storage devices, power supply unit (PSU), graphics card, and peripherals.
5. Take note of cable connections and routing for future reference during reassembly.
6. Once the PC is fully disassembled, each group will gather around their workstation to identify and discuss the function of each component.
7. After identifying each component, instruct the groups to follow proper assembly procedures to rebuild the PC. REMEMBER!!! It is important to handle the components with care, aligning connectors correctly, and securing components firmly in place.
8. Once the PC is reassembled, power on the system and perform basic functionality tests to ensure everything is working correctly, i.e. verify that the system boots up properly, recognizes all installed components, and can perform basic tasks such as accessing the BIOS or operating system.
9. Discuss and share as a class any challenges your group may have encountered during the disassembly and reassembly process, as well as lessons learned and best practices observed.

Submission:

No formal submission is required for this workshop. However, students are encouraged to take photos or videos of their disassembly and reassembly process as a personal record of their learning experience.
